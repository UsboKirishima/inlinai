## Features

- **Prompt-based Command Generation:** The tool asks for a prompt and generates shell commands based on that prompt.
- **Run Commands:** After generating the commands, the tool asks if you want to execute them in your terminal.
- **Hugging Face Integration:** The tool uses the Hugging Face API and the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` model to generate relevant shell commands.
